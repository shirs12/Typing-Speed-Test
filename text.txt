The three-year-old girl ran down the beach as the kite flew behind her.
It was the best sandcastle he had ever seen
Today I heard something new and unmemorable
It always seems impossible until it's done
She had some amazing news to share but nobody to share it with
The rain pelted the windshield as the darkness engulfed us
With the new day comes new strength and new thoughts
She could not understand why nobody else could see that the sky is full of cotton candy
He told us a very exciting adventure story
She had the gift of being able to paint songs
He wanted a pet platypus but ended up getting a duck and a ferret instead
It was a perfect Monday for being a Saturday
All you need to do is pick up the pen and begin
I may struggle with geography, but I am sure I am somewhere around here
The waves were crashing on the shore it was a lovely sight
She only paints with bold colors she does not like pastels
As he looked out the window he saw a clown walk by
The book is in front of the table
